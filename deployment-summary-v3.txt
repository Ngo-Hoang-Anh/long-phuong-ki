LONG PHUONG KI GAME V3 - DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY
===========================================

DEPLOYMENT OVERVIEW
------------------
This document summarizes the deployment process for version 3 of the Long Phuong Ki game, which will be deployed to the same infrastructure as version 2.

SERVICES USED
------------
1. Fly.io - Front-end and Back-end hosting (same instances as v2)
2. MongoDB Atlas - Database hosting (same database as v2)
3. Custom Domain (if configured in v2) - Same domain will be used

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM V2
----------------------
- Reusing the same Fly.io applications (long-phuong-backend-fragrant-silence-300 and long-phuong-frontend)
- Updating the existing deployments rather than creating new ones
- Maintaining the same MongoDB Atlas database connection

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
-----------------
1. In-place update of the existing Fly.io applications
2. Zero-downtime deployment (if possible)
3. Ability to roll back to v2 if issues are encountered

ESTIMATED COSTS
--------------
The cost structure remains the same as v2:

Fly.io:
- Free tier: 3 shared-CPU VMs with 256MB RAM each
- 160GB outbound data transfer/month
- COST: $0/month for your usage pattern (2-4 users, ~5 hours per week)

MongoDB Atlas:
- M0 Free Tier (512MB storage)
- COST: $0/month

Custom Domain (if applicable):
- Renewal costs: ~$15-20/year

TOTAL MONTHLY COST: $0/month (within free tier limits)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS SUMMARY
----------------------
1. Copy deployment files from v2 to v3 (Dockerfiles, fly.toml, nginx.conf)
2. Deploy the back-end to the existing Fly.io application
3. Deploy the front-end to the existing Fly.io application
4. Test all functionality
5. Monitor for any issues

ROLLBACK PLAN
------------
If issues are encountered with v3:
1. Document the current image IDs before deployment
2. If needed, roll back to v2 using the previous image IDs:
   - flyctl deploy --image [v2-image-id] -a long-phuong-backend-fragrant-silence-300
   - flyctl deploy --image [v2-image-id] -a long-phuong-frontend

MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------
1. Database growth - Monitor MongoDB Atlas usage to ensure you stay within free tier limits
2. Fly.io resource usage - Monitor CPU and memory usage to ensure you stay within free tier limits
3. Regular backups - Consider implementing regular database backups

CONCLUSION
---------
Deploying v3 to the same infrastructure as v2 provides a cost-effective and straightforward approach. By reusing the existing Fly.io applications and MongoDB Atlas database, you minimize the risk of configuration issues and maintain the same URLs for your users.
